Autopilot is in closed early access and currently supporting EC2 only. Please contact support@vantage.sh to opt in. Autopilot is a managed service for AWS customers that automatically applies Reserved Instances and Savings Plans on your behalf. It workes by regularly evaluating your compute workloads and procuring no upfront Reserved Instances and no upfront Savings Plans on your behalf to ensure that you're always maximizing your savings from a commitment perspective. Autopilot charges a fee of 5% of the savings found to align interests with you to maximize savings. In the event that your compute workloads decrease, Autopilot will automatically sell out of Reserved Instances to ensure that you're not overcommitted. Depending on your workload, Autopilot can reduce your compute costs by up to 68%. What Permissions does Autopilot need? # The full set of IAM permissions for Autopilot will be listed soon. At a high level, Autopilot requires permissions which grant: The ability to list and describe existing reserved instances The ability to register you as a reserved instance marketplace seller. The ability to contact support to increase certain AWS limits (the number of reserved instances) The ability to buy and sell Reserved Instances. How Does Autopilot work? # Autopilot works by ingesting and analyzing Cost and Usage Report data. Vantage will structure your compute workloads by instance hour of each respective compute class. A compute class is defined as EC2 instance usage structured by instance type (i.e. t3.xlarge, r5.large, etc), region (us-east-1, us-west-2, etc) and platform (Linux, Windows, etc) tracked hourly. After structure compute data for each compute class, Autopilot will look at existing coverage of existing AWS Savings Plans and Reserved Instances and determine what remaining on-demand compute usage is available to optimize on a per compute class basis. Where Autopilot believes it can find you savings, it will begin purchasing corresponding reserved instances. Where Autopilot sees that you're overcommitted on a particular compute class, it will look to sell out of corresponding reserved instances. I have existing AWS Savings Plans and Reserved Instances - will Autopilot account for these? # Yes. Autopilot will account for your existing AWS Savings Plans and Reserved Instances. You will not be charged for existing AWS Savings Plans or Reserved Instances. Even if you feel that you have good coverage with existing AWS Savings Plans and Reserved Instances, you should consider enabling Autopilot as an insurance policy in the event that they expire.

Vantage uses a mechanism called a \"Cross Account IAM Role\" to interact with services in your AWS account. AWS has publicly documented this method and officially recommends it as the preferred method of doing any cross account interactions on AWS. Numerous internal AWS services and systems also leverage this method. This means that Vantage never needs access credentials, account logins or passwords. Note that everyone who works at Vantage has previously worked in public cloud infrastructure including companies like AWS, DigitalOcean, Github, Akamai and Cloudflare and we are taking best practices learned at those companies into consideration when building Vantage. Read Only by Default # When you create a Cross Account IAM Role using the provided CloudFormation template you are giving Vantage various permissions . All of the permissions by default are ReadOnly. The list of permissions was created by using the official AWS ReadOnly policy and removing some of the permissions AWS includes in that list in order to prevent Vantage from seeing information like reading from S3 Buckets and reading from databases. Vantage only collects metadata about your infrastructure and never even attempts to read sensitive information from the underlying services. Our CloudFormation template is public and you may audit the list of permissions here . Connecting Multiple AWS Accounts # Vantage allows you to connect multiple AWS accounts. We advise that you connect your master AWS account first. By default, we require you to start with one AWS account and ensure it properly connected. Upon connecting a master AWS account, Vantage will profile for all member accounts present in the organization. Vantage will be able to show you accrued costs from all member accounts in the organization as well as active resources that are present in that master AWS account . In the event that you have multiple member accounts and want to view Active Resources present in those accounts, Vantage will offer you the ability to run something called a CloudFormation StackSet that will create one role per AWS member account. You're also welcome to skip this step and add/remove AWS accounts from your account settings whenever you see fit. We recommend using StackSets if you have several accounts you would like to connect. This will automate the process for all of the accounts in your Organizational Unit. When connecting your account, if you have at least one member account, you will see instructions specific to your account on how to connect your member accounts using StackSets. StackSet Prerequisites # Note that in order to leverage StackSets, you must enable organizations access to operate a service managed stack set. You'll need to enable this in the AWS Console UI. In the event you don't have this enabled and attempt to run a StackSet command you'll get the following error: An error occurred (ValidationError) when calling the CreateStackSet operation: You must enable organizations access to operate a service managed stack set AWS maintains instructions for the latest way of enabling this which you can find here .

Create a BigQuery dataset # Sign in to the Google Cloud Console and go to the BigQuery page In the Project drop-down list at the top of the console, select the project you set up to contain your Cloud Billing data In the Explorer panel, click the three vertical dots button next to your project ID Click the Create dataset button Enter a Dataset ID . We recommend an ID that spans projects, such as \"all_billing_data\", rather than a project-specific ID Select a Data location . Choose either us (multiple regions in United States) or eu (multiple regions in European Union) . One of these two options is required for enabling detailed usage cost data Leave the Enable table expiration checkbox unchecked to ensure that data never expires. Set the Encryption option to Google-managed key. Note: Customer-managed key encryption is not supported for exporting Cloud Billing data records to BigQuery To save, click the Create dataset button Enable Cloud Billing export to the BigQuery dataset # Open the console Navigation menu , and then select Billing In the Billing navigation menu , select Billing export Select the BigQuery export tab (this tab is selected by default) Under Detailed usage cost , click the Edit settings button From the Projects list, select the project you set up to contain your billing data From the Dataset ID field, select the dataset that you set up to contain your exported Cloud Billing data Click the Save button Congrats! Your Cloud Billing data will now begin stored in the BigQuery dataset you created. To continue connecting your GCP account to Vantage, return to the instructions here . Note: It typically takes a few hours for data to start appearing. Cloud Billing data is added retroactively for the current and previous month when detailed usage cost data is configured.

Slack : You can deliver a notification to one or more public or private channels in a Slack workspace. Microsoft Teams : You can deliver a notification to one of more public or private channels in a Microsoft Team account. Prior to sending you this email, Vantage will automatically issue an sync with your infrastructure accounts to ensure it has an up-to-date representation of your cost data to give you an accurrate cost report.

Vantage will process Cost and Usage Report data to analyze every single instance hour running in your account and has built up a pricing database with millions of different price permutations to calculate your exact savings rate across different EC2 instance types, Lambda functions and Fargate Services. This data is kept up-to-date as often as a Cost and Usage Report is processed which is typically every 7-8 hours. This allows you to always have the most accurrate view of your infrastructure data and corresponding savings. You can also arbitrarily change future expected compute spend either up [or down] to see what the impact would be on your savings plan and reserved instance coverage vesus on-demand. Savings Planner allows you to create \"Models\" with these scenarios which can be shared with everyone on your team and referenced at future times to analyze.","title":"Savings Planner"},{"location":"security/","text":"As an infrastructure tool that requires access to your cloud provider we understand there may be questions, concerns and necessary clarification around our own infrastructure, processes and procedures. We as developers on Vantage are also customers of Vantage to more closely align our security concerns with those of our customers. Lastly, our team has worked at public cloud infrastructure providers including Amazon Web Services and DigitalOcean and are applying best practices learned at these providers to ensure security is handled as best it can. Cross Account IAM Roles # Vantage leverages something called Cross Account IAM Roles to sync information about your infrastructure resources. This means we don't store sensitive information like account access keys and access key secrets to use Vantage. This method is the AWS recommended approach and is detailed in depth by AWS here for you to learn more. When you grant access to your AWS account to Vantage by running the provided CloudFormation stack, it creates a cross account role with in-line policies selected by Vantage. These policies are a trimmed down version of the policies in the AWS-managed \"ReadOnlyAccess\" policy but we've removed actions that would otherwise allow us to access sensitive information in databases, buckets and certain services. Our CloudFormation template is open source and hosted publicly here for transparency. Should you have any other questions please feel free to email us at security@vantage.sh. Customizing Cross Account Role Permissions # Vantage requests various in-line read-only permissions when creating the cross account role on your behalf. However, we understand this can be too broad of a permission set for certain use-cases. As a result, we do allow for creating Cross Account IAM roles with whatever permissions you're comfortable with. It is important to understand that as a result of narrowing the scope of the permissions Vantage has certain functionality that will be limited. If you email support@vantage.sh in advance of that we are happy to facilite provisioning your account with a custom role prior to then. Please note that we will provide you with some custom attributes to associate with your Cross Account Role to prevent against the Confused Deputy problem so please contact Vantage support prior to creating your role. Data Caching # Data about your cloud infrastructure is cached on Vantage's production infrastructure. We do this in order to provide a fast and user-friendly experience. We do not cache all information about your cloud infrastructure. In the event you remove your account with Vantage, we delete all corresponding data from our databases. All data is encrypted at rest and in transit wherever possible. Data Revocation # In your account settings page you have the ability to revoke the Cross Account IAM Role at any time. Automatically and nearly instantly, Vantage will delete all data associated with that Cross Account IAM Role. It doesn't remove your set of custom Vantage Views created - however all of those views will be empty as there are no resources. In your account settings page you also have the ability to delete your account. Upon deleting your account all data is deleted. Team Security # Everyone on our team has spent time working at a major cloud infrastructure provider and is well versed in cloud security.

Vantage integrates with Terraform Cloud through the Run Tasks API . This allows your team to get visiblity on cloud costs as part of their existing workflows in two different ways: Cost Saving Recommendations : Vantage will post a current snapshot of cost savings that can be applied to help you save money. Accrued Costs and Forecasts : Vantage will post a current snapshot of your current accrued costs and your expected forecast for the current month. This integration is provided at no additional cost to all Vantage users, including users in the free tier. Getting setup only takes a few minutes and you can follow steps to opt-in below.

This allows you to see all of your costs within a single cloud provider, like AWS, or across multiple cloud providers (e.g. GCP + Azure). A Workspace is a way to segregate costs from individual account(s) within a provider, or across providers, into their own discrete dashboard. This allows teams to create more focused views of costs and even restrict access to costs by utilizing role-based access controls (RBAC) if they are subscribers of the Vantage Enterprise plan . When your Vantage account is created you are assigned a \"Default\" workspace. You have the ability to create multiple workspaces. Each workspace is a logical grouping of cloud provider account(s) and has its own respective set of views. Use-Cases # Grouping resources together multiple cloud provider accounts: An organization sometimes has multiple accounts within the same cloud provider. Vantage users can use a single workspace to group multiple cloud provider accounts together to view all resources in the same view. Grouping costs together across multiple cloud providers: An organization sometimes has multiple cloud providers (e.g. AWS + GCP). Vantage users can use a single workspace to group multiple cloud provider accounts together to view all resources in the same view. Separate costs per environment: Organizations separate costs based on the environment that the resources in the account relate to. A workspace per environment; grouping all production, staging and development resources into separate workspaces. Separate costs per team: Organizations separate costs based on the team that utilizes the resources in an account. Separate workspaces per team, e.g., infrastructure, product, security, etc. Separate costs per product/service: Organizations separate costs based on the product or service that utilizes the resouces in an account. Separate workspaces per product/service, e.g., payment, console, admin Separate costs per customer: Organizations separate costs based on customers. Separate workspaces per customer, e.g., Customer A, Customer B, Customer C, etc. When you have more than one workspace in your Vantage account a workspace menu will appear in your navigation menu for you to switch between workspaces.","title":"Workspaces"},{"location":"workspaces/#use-cases","text":"Grouping resources together multiple cloud provider accounts: An organization sometimes has multiple accounts within the same cloud provider.
