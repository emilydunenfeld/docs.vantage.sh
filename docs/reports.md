Vantage will send you weekly cost reports for each [Vantage workspace](/workspaces) to the email on your account. Prior to sending you this email, we'll automatically issue an sync with your AWS account to ensure it has an up-to-date representation of your resources to give you an accurrate cost report.

The email report will contain a list of all of your views and a point-in-time cost for each view so you can make sure you don't have any surprises on your next AWS bill.

## Future Work

We have two features in development slated for Q1, '21:

* **Slack support**: If you would like to receive reports by Slack instead of by email, you'll be able to provide a Slack webhook URL. 
* **Frequency adjustment**: Some customers want to be informed daily or not at all. We are working on the ability to adjust frequency of how often you get this report.
