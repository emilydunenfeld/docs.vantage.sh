Vantage has the concept of Cost Report Notifications which allow you to receive either daily, weekly or monthly reports for one or more Cost Reports delivered either. Below are the currently supported methods for receiving a Cost Report Notification:

* **E-Mail**: You can deliver a notification to one or more email addresses.  
* **Slack**: You can deliver a notification to one or more public or private channels in a Slack workspace. 
* **Microsoft Teams**: You can deliver a notification to one of more public or private channels in a Microsoft Team account. 

Prior to sending you this email, Vantage will automatically issue an sync with your infrastructure accounts to ensure it has an up-to-date representation of your cost data to give you an accurrate cost report.

The email report will contain a list of all of your views and a point-in-time cost for each view so you can make sure you don't have any surprises on your next AWS bill.
