Saved Filters give you the ability to save and reuse filter logic across multiple Cost Reports. A Saved Filter will have any filter logic you would like along with a name for that filter. Once created, the filter can be added to any number of reports.

Head to the [Saved Filters](https://console.vantage.sh/saved_filters) page in Cost Reporting to create or update your filters. You must have editor permissions to update Saved Filters and add them to Cost Reports.

When combining multiple Saved Filters on Cost Reports, "AND" logic will be used. This is in contrast to combining multiple normal filters where "OR" logic is used.
