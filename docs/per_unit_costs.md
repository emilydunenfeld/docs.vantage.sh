# Per Unit Costs

Unit Costs are a visualization on Cost Reports which display cloud infrastructure costs on a per-unit basis. A unit can be any metric that your business tracks such as users, requests, transactions, customers, vendors, and so on. By importing these Business Metrics into Vantage, you can add them to Cost Reports to track things like cost per daily active user, COGS per customer, cost per million API requests, and more.
