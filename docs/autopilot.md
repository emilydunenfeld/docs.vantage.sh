Autopilot is a managed service that automatically applies Reserved Instances and Savings Plans on your behalf. It workes by regularly evaluating your compute workloads and procuring **no upfront** Reserved Instances on your behalf to ensure that you're always maximizing your savings from a commitment perspective. Autopilot charges a fee of 5% of the savings found to align interests with you to maximize savings. In the event that your compute workloads decrease, Autopilot will automatically sell out of Reserved Instances to ensure that you're not overcommitted. 

Depending on your workload, Vantage can reduce your compute costs by up to 68%.
