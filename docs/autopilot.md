Autopilot is a managed service for AWS customers that automatically applies Reserved Instances on your behalf. It works by regularly evaluating your compute workloads and procuring **no upfront** Reserved Instances on your behalf to ensure that you're always maximizing your savings from a commitment perspective. Autopilot charges a fee of 5% of the savings found to align interests with you to maximize savings. In the event that your compute workloads decrease, Autopilot will automatically list to sell out of Reserved Instances on the EC2 Reserved Instance Marketplace to ensure that you're not overcommitted. Please note that there is a minimum 30 day hold time imposed by AWS for all reserved instances so you should only enable Autopilot if you don't expect material downward changes in your infrastructure within 30 days. You can further control what actions Autopilot takes with [Autopilot Controls](#autopilot-controls).

Depending on your mix of EC2 instances used, Autopilot can reduce your compute costs by over 60%.

## Autopilot Pricing

Autopilot only charges 5% of the _savings found_. This means that in the event that Autopilot doesn't find you any savings, then its free to you to use. 

As example in the event that your EC2 bill is $10,000 per month and Autopilot buys you enough reserved instances to save you $3,000 per month, the corresponding Autopilot fee will be $150 so your net savings is $2,850 per month. 


!!! contribute "Don't worry: You won't be charged for existing Reserved Instances or Savings Plans."
     Autopilot will respect your existing Savings Plans and Reserved Instances and you won't pay any Autopilot fees for existing commitments. 


## What Permissions does Autopilot need?

The full set of IAM permissions for Autopilot are listed below. To summarize the scope of the permissions needed for Autopilot to run, we require the ability to purchase reserved instances for EC2, ElasticSearch, Redshift and RDS. We also require permission to view service quotas to understand what commitment levels we can make based off of the limits in your account.

Autopilot can not and will never attempt to augment production workloads, read from databases or access network data. Autopilot purely is making financial commitments on your behalf to help save you money.

## How Does Autopilot work?

Autopilot works by ingesting and analyzing Cost and Usage Report data. Vantage will structure your compute workloads by instance hour of each respective compute class. A compute class is defined as EC2 instance usage structured by instance type (i.e. t3.xlarge, r5.large, etc), region (us-east-1, us-west-2, etc) and platform (Linux, Windows, etc) tracked hourly.

After structuring compute data for each compute class, Autopilot will look at existing coverage of existing AWS Savings Plans and Reserved Instances and determine what remaining on-demand compute usage is available to optimize on a per compute class basis. Where Autopilot believes it can find you savings, it will begin purchasing corresponding reserved instances. Where Autopilot sees that you're overcommitted on a particular compute class, it will look to sell out of corresponding reserved instances. Autopilot will only ever sell out of reserved instances Autopilot has purchased and will not attempt to sell out of reserved instances that you've already purchased in your account.  

For each compute category, Autopilot is also looking at "peaks and valleys" of usage to ensure it avoids overcommitment. In some cases where there are very spikey workloads, a target coverage rates for reserved instances may be very low to achieve cost savings without the concern of overcommitment. For more normalized workloads, a target coverage rate will be on the higher side as there less concern over overcommitment. 

## I have existing AWS Savings Plans and Reserved Instances - will Autopilot account for these?

Yes. Autopilot will account for your existing AWS Savings Plans and Reserved Instances. You will not be charged for existing AWS Savings Plans or Reserved Instances. Even if you feel that you have good coverage with existing AWS Savings Plans and Reserved Instances, you should consider enabling Autopilot as an insurance policy in the event that they expire. Autopilot will automatically detect that your coverage is slipping if anything were to expire and purchase additional Reserved Instances to account for things accordingly. 

## How do I register as a seller in the AWS Reserved Instance Marketplace?

Autopilot requires that you register as a seller in the AWS reserved instance marketplace before any actions are taken. This is what enables Autopilot to sell reserved instances you are no longer using. You can follow these <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ri-market-general.html#ri-market-seller-profile">instructions</a> to complete the seller registration process. As part of this process filling out tax information is optional, however Autopilot requires you complete this step in order to ensure your reserved instances can be sold in the marketplace.

## Are there any timelines I need to be aware of?

AWS imposes a minimum 30-day hold time for all Reserved Instances before you can list them for sale on the AWS EC2 Reserved Instance marketplace. As a result, you shouldn't enable Autopilot if you expect significant *downward* changes in your infrastructure within the first 30 days of enabling Autopilot as they can't technically be listed for sale. If you expect *growth*, there are no concerns around this limitation. 

## Autopilot Controls

![Autopilot Controls](/img/autopilot_controls.png)

You can see what actions Autopilot may take or is taking under [Settings](https://console.vantage.sh/financial_planning/autopilot/settings) in the Autopilot page in the console. Here, you can control Autopilot on a per-compute category basis, disabling it and enabling it as needed.

A compute category is a Vantage primitive that is a representation of your normalized EC2 workloads that consists of the following:

- An instance type family such as "m5a".
- A region.
- A platform (Windows, Linux, RHEL, Windows SQL Server, etc..)

Each compute category has usage tracked hourly and grouped by the following compute types. Note that Windows, SUSE and RedHat Reserved Instances are targeted at a specific instance type, e.g. m5.2xlarge, instead of the entire family.

- Existing customer usage covered by existing Reserved Instances
- Existing customer usage covered by existing Savings Plans
- Existing customer usage covered by credits
- On-demand usage

Each compute category will have a target commitment level shown with the ability to disable the category completely. If you disable a compute category after Autopilot has already made purchases for it, Autopilot will immediately beging listing the reserved instances for sale. 

Compute categories can be saved prior to enabling Autopilot and adjusted after enabling Autopilot as well. For example, you may decide initially that you do not want Autopilot to manage purchasing and selling RIs for a new service. After the service sees increasing usage, you may then decide to turn on Autopilot for it.

Autopilot Controls can be changed as often as youâ€™d like. That being said, we generally recommend to do one round of adjusting settings prior to enabling Autopilot and then adjusting things as you see fit.

Once a setting is changed, the changes take effect between 24 and 48 hours. Autopilot purposefully will impose a minimum 24 hour delay before making any changes from Autopilot controls. Please note that because of a 30 day minimum holding period made by AWS with reserved instances, there may be certain cases where even adjusting controls could take some time to be applied.
