# GCP Permissions

Vantage requests extremely basic and limited permissions for GCP unlike our deeper integration for [AWS accounts](/permissions_aws/). The generated Google Service Account only needs to be granted access to the specific Big Query dataset that contains your billing data in a specific project in your account. While we have broader plans for deeper integrations for GCP in time, this is the only permission required.
