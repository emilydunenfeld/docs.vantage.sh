# Folders

Create folders to organize all your cost Cost Reports. In organizations with many Cost Reports, you can create folders to separate Cost Reports for different business units or cost centers. You can quickly create and name folders, move Cost Reports to these folders, and nest folders within each other to create complex organizational structures.

## Create a Folder

1. From the top navigation, click **Cost Reporting**.
2. On the left menu, select **Cost Reports**.
3. On the top right, click the down arrow next to **+ New**.
4. Select **New Folder**.
5. Enter a name for the folder, then click **Create**.
6. The new folder is displayed in the Cost Report list. Click the folder to open it.
7. At the top of the folder, click the down arrow next to **+New**. You can create a new Cost Report inside the folder or a sub-folder within the folder.

## Add Existing Cost Reports to a Folder

1. From the Cost Reports screen, click the ellipses (**...**) next to any Cost Report.
2. Select **Move to...**.
3. Select any list folder, then click **Move Here**.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", boxShadow: "0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)", borderRadius: "10px", overflow: "hidden" }}>
    <img alt="GIF of moving a Cost Report from the main reports screen to a specific folder" width="100%" src="/img/move-report-to-folder.gif"/>
</div>
<br/>

To move a Cost Report out of a folder and back to the main Cost Reports view:

1. From the Cost Reports screen, click the ellipses (**...**) next to any Cost Report.
2. Select **Move to...**.
3. At the top of the **Move Report** modal, click **< Back** until **All Reports (current)** is displayed at the top.
4. Click **Move Here**.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", boxShadow: "0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)", borderRadius: "10px", overflow: "hidden" }}>
    <img alt="GIF of moving a Cost Report out of a specific folder and back to the main Cost Reports screen" width="100%" src="/img/move-to-all-resources.gif"/>
</div>
<br/>

Cost Report folders include several additional features for sharing and quickly viewing costs. By pressing the new "View in Overview" button in the top right of any folder, you can see all of its reports summarized on the Overview page. From that page you can also share a link with teammates. For example, you can organize all the costs associated with one team or business unit in one folder then share the link with that team so they can view all their costs in one place.

## Create a Dashboard from a Folder

You can create a [dashboard](/dashboards) made up of all the reports within a folder. 

1. Navigate to any folder. 
2. At the top, click **Dashboard**. A dashboard containing all included reports is displayed. 
3. If you want to save the dashboard, click **Save As New**. This saved dashboard will be shareable and available within the main **Dashboards** view.
