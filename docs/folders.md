Cost Report folders give you an easy way to organize Cost Reports. You can quickly create and name folders, move Cost Reports to these folders and nest folders within each other to create complex organizational structures. There is also a global search feature to quickly find either Cost Reports or folders. For a quick reference to your most important reports, you can "star" Cost Reports or folders. Navigate to the [reporting page](https://console.vantage.sh/reporting) in the console to make use of folders.

Cost Report folders include several additional features for sharing and quickly viewing costs. By pressing the new "View in Overview" button in the top right of any folder, you can see all of its reports summarized on the Overview page. From that page you can also share a link with teammates. For example, you can organize all the costs associated with one team or business unit in one folder then share the link with that team so they can view all their costs in one place.
