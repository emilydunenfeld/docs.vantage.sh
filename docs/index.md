# Overview

Despite being a hosted Software-as-a-Service product we wanted to devote a portion of our site to documentation to explain how certain features and systems work. If you believe something is missing, please contact us at support@vantage.sh and we are happy to update this site as soon as we can. 

## General information

Vantage is an alternative to the AWS console with a focus on developer experience and cost transparency. It is free to get started and you can upgrade to [premium plans](https://www.vantage.sh/pricing) to unlock additional functionality. Vantage works by occasionally syncing with your AWS account, determining what resources were added, deleted, edited and augmented to provide you with a fast and intuitive-to-use console.

## Slack community

While the documentation here is meant to help answer any questions, you're also welcome to join our Slack community to join the discussion and ask questions. You can join the Slack community [here](https://join.slack.com/t/vantagecommunity/shared_invite/zt-k429eawn-NbbDu3Sbe51JR2plAyhH_Q).
