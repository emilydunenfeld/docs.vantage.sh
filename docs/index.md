# Overview

Despite being a hosted Software-as-a-Service product we wanted to devote a portion of our site to documentation to explain how certain features and systems work. If you believe something is missing, please contact us at support@vantage.sh and we are happy to update this site as soon as we can. 

## General information

Vantage is a cloud cost transparency platform. It is free to get started and you can upgrade to [premium plans](https://www.vantage.sh/pricing) to unlock additional functionality and track more in AWS costs. Vantage works by looking at your accrued AWS costs and occasionally syncing with your AWS account to determining what resources are present to provide you with a fast and intuitive-to-use console for interacting with your AWS costs.

## Slack community

While the documentation here is meant to help answer any questions, you're also welcome to join our Slack community to join the discussion and ask questions. You can join the Slack community [here](https://join.slack.com/t/vantagecommunity/shared_invite/zt-oey52myv-gq4AWRKkX25kjp1UGziPTw).
