## Community Resources

Vantage maintains a variety of resources to help make the lives of cloud practictioners easier. All of the resources below are free to use and open source when possible.

### EC2Instances.info
[EC2Instances.info](https://instances.vantage.sh/) is a site dedicated to making it simple and intuitive to look up the cost of an EC2 instance on AWS. Due to the number of EC2 instance types and the differing price per region and avilability zone, there are over a million possible permutations of pricing for a resource. EC2Instances.info was built to help users quickly narrow down the resource that are applicable to their situation and compare pricing.

### Cloud Cost Handbook
The [Cloud Cost Handbook](https://handbook.vantage.sh/) is a free, open-source, community-supported set of guides meant to help explain the complex pricing of public cloud infrastructure and service providers in easy-to-understand terms. This guide is [hosted on Github](https://github.com/vantage-sh/handbook) and is open to anyone to contribute their knowledge to the community.

### AWS Cost Leaderboard
The [AWS Cost Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.vantage.sh/) is a site showing a rank list of AWS services that customers spend the most on. Vantage provides this anonymized and aggregated data to the community in order to shed light on cloud infrastructure costs.
