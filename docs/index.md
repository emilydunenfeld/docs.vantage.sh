# Overview

Despite being a hosted Software-as-a-Service, we devote a portion of our site to documentation to explain how certain features and systems work. If you believe something is missing, please contact us at support@vantage.sh and we are happy to update this site. 

## General information

Vantage is a cloud cost transparency platform. Vantage aggregates cloud infrastructure costs across all cloud providers to deliver a centralized view into total cloud spend. 

It is free to get started. You can upgrade to a [premium plan](https://www.vantage.sh/pricing) to unlock additional functionality and track more cloud infrastructure costs. 

## Slack community

While the documentation here is meant to help answer any questions, you're also welcome to join our Slack community to join the discussion and ask questions. You can join the Slack community [here](https://join.slack.com/t/vantagecommunity/shared_invite/zt-oey52myv-gq4AWRKkX25kjp1UGziPTw).
