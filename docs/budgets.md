# Budgets

Vantage users can create and assign a Budget to a Cost Report. Once a budget is assigned, it is easy to see how costs are trending for a particular service, business unit or team compared to their prescribed budget.

To create a budget, head to the [Budgets](https://console.vantage.sh/financial_planning/budgets) tool in the console. Budgets are scoped to a specific [workspace](/workspaces/), and access can be controlled via Teams.

## Linking Budgets to Cost Reports

Budget data lives right alongside spend and forecasts in [Cost Reports](/cost_reports/). When you create a Budget, you can assign it to a Cost Report. Once assigned, the budget will report on month-to-date performance from within the cost report view.

Budgets show as a yellow line in the cumulative and daily, weekly, and monthly views. The budget does not show if Group By is selected. To return to the Budgets tool, click on the name of the budget in the right-hand side. If you select the Weekly view, you may see the budget line dip for the first and last week of the month. This is because the budget is metered per day.

On the Budgets page you can click the 3 dots to edit the Budget, assign it to a different cost report, rename it, and so on.

## Budget Periods

Budgets can have multiple budget periods, one for each month, with a specific amount for each period. If you create a budget for a past date, it cannot be edited.
