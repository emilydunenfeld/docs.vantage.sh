Users can now create [dashboards](https://console.vantage.sh/dashboards) and apply date range and period filters to all reports present on them. The period can be Cumulative, Monthly, Weekly or Daily. You can add cost reports and cost allocation reports to dashboards by clicking "Edit". Reports are displayed on the dashboard in alphabetical order. At this time you cannot add widgets from the overview page such as Provider Summary.

You can star dashboards so that they appear in "Starred by me". Dashboards will also show up in "Recently Viewed". You can save dashboards or save new dashboards with the "Save" button in the top right. If you are viewing all the reports in a folder as a dashboard, you can save this dashboard by choosing "Save as New".
