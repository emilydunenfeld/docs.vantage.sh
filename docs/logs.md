Vantage attempts to give you CloudWatch logs on each resource page so you don't need to waste time finding the corresponding log group. On resources that support CloudWatch logs there will be a tab entitled "Logs" that you can click on and see logs in-line on like below. Additionally, we try to do the heavy lifting of seamlessly moving from one log stream to another to give you a fluid experience. 

Cloudwatch logs are configured automatically per resource when you connect an AWS account to Vantage.
